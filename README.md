# Flask + Electron Integration - Template

This project demonstrates how to integrate a Flask backend with an Electron frontend. Flask serves as the backend server, while Electron provides the desktop application interface. The integration allows you to build a desktop app with Python-powered backend logic and a modern JavaScript-based frontend.

## Features
- Flask backend for handling API requests.
- Electron frontend for a desktop application interface.
- Live reload for Electron using `electron-reload`.
- Concurrently running Flask and Electron for seamless development.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask)
- Node.js (Electron)
- `electron-reload` for live updates
- `concurrently` for running both servers simultaneously
